# Randomizer

## Simple password generator vanilla JS

Written many years ago with JQuery and JQuery UI sortable/draggable with touch support but now simplified and slightly updated August 2018.

A simple web page which can be used to generate a random string of characters of any desired length using the `alphanum` variable as a starting point.

It was interesting to come back to this code after so many years. There was no need for the addition of drag and drop which I'd re-used from another project and therefore there was no need for the overhead of JQuery and its UI companion. I added a few cosmetic changes and a function to copy the result to the clipboard. There are obviously lots of ways of doing this (I even have a spreadsheet version), most of them no doubt much better than this but I still use it.

There is a demo [here](https://simplerandomizer.onrender.com/)
